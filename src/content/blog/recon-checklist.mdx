<Callout type="note" title="Goal">
This post is a **template** you can reuse every CTF: same phases, same logs, same artifacts — faster reports later.
</Callout>

## 1) Snapshot the target

Capture:
- URL(s), time, IPs, headers, TLS info
- Any obvious frameworks (`Server`, `X-Powered-By`, cookie names)

<TerminalBlock title="$ quick headers">
curl -i -sS https://example.ctf/ | sed -n '1,20p'
</TerminalBlock>

## 2) Map attack surface

- Routes & APIs (look for `/api`, `/graphql`, `/swagger`, `/admin`)
- Auth flows (SSO? reset? invite?)
- Uploads and parsers (PDF/ZIP/Office/Images)
- SSRF sinks (URL fetchers, preview cards)

## 3) Record hypotheses, not just payloads

For each lead, note:
- **Why you suspect it**
- What you tried
- What would falsify it quickly

<Callout type="tip" title="Writeup speed hack">
During the game, write down *tiny* bullet points. After the game, expand them into narrative.
</Callout>

## 4) Save everything needed for reproducibility

- Docker compose / dependencies
- Wordlists / scripts
- Version strings / fingerprints
- Minimal PoC request sequence
